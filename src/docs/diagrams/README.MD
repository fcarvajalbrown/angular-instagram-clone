## The C4 Model

The C4 model is a lean graphical notation for describing the architecture of software systems, created by Simon Brown between 2006 and 2011. It takes its name from its four hierarchical levels of abstraction: Context, Container, Component, and Code.

The model was built as a reaction to the decline of UML in practice. Many teams had reverted to informal, inconsistent boxes-and-lines diagrams that were hard to read and impossible to compare. C4 introduces just enough structure to make diagrams useful across different audiences — from non-technical stakeholders to developers working on a specific module — without mandating a complex notation.

The four levels work as zoom levels into a system:

**Level 1 — System Context.** The highest view. Shows the system being built, the people who use it, and the external systems it depends on. Intended for any audience, including non-technical ones.

**Level 2 — Container.** Zooms into the system boundary and shows the deployable or runnable units: web apps, APIs, databases, mobile apps, and so on. Each container is a separately runnable process or storage unit.

**Level 3 — Component.** Zooms into a single container and shows the major structural building blocks inside it — services, repositories, controllers, and similar. Intended for developers working on that container.

**Level 4 — Code.** The lowest level, showing classes, interfaces, and their relationships. C4 acknowledges that this level is often generated directly from an IDE or tooling, and treats it as optional.

C4 is tool-agnostic and notation-agnostic. It does not prescribe colors, shapes, or layout beyond recommending that every diagram carry a title, a clear legend, and unambiguous labels. The official website and reference are maintained by Simon Brown at [https://c4model.com](https://c4model.com).

## Mermaid

Mermaid is an open-source diagramming tool that renders diagrams from plain text definitions written in a Markdown-like syntax. It runs in the browser and is natively supported by platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Notion, and Obsidian, which makes it a practical choice for keeping architecture diagrams alongside source code without requiring external tools.

Mermaid includes experimental support for C4 diagrams through its `C4Context`, `C4Container`, `C4Component`, `C4Dynamic`, and `C4Deployment` diagram types. The syntax is compatible with C4-PlantUML. As of the current version, certain features of the C4 spec — such as custom tags, legend generation, and directional layout statements — are not yet fully supported.

## Warning

These diagrams were generated by an AI assistant (Claude, by Anthropic) by analyzing the source code at a point in time. They may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or interpretations that do not fully reflect the intended architecture. They should be treated as a starting point for discussion rather than authoritative documentation, and reviewed by a developer familiar with the codebase before being used as a reference.

Corrections and improvements are welcome.
